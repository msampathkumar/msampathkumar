I'm a Python Software Engineer with 8 yrs of Experience in IT. I like data engineering, data analytics and data science. I am currently working as a Principle Engineer at Pramati Technologies. Pramati is into Product development and Software Services.

In the recent past, I have working with US & UK clients addressing challenges related to big data, data engineering pipelines and build scalable solutions in cloud platforms like AWS, GCp and Azure.

My long term dream is to build & lead a R & D team where I share my passion for new technologies while also building innovative solutions for my organisation as well as the open source community.
